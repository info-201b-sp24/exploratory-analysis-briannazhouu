Describe why you included the table and what information it reveals

### Chart 1

setwd("~/Downloads")
data <- read.csv("test.csv")
print(data)
install.packages("ggplot2")
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data, aes(x = race, fill = workclass)) + 
  geom_bar(position = "dodge") +
  labs(x = "Race", y = "Count", fill = "Work Class", title = "Comparing Race and Work Class")
#{r, echo = FALSE, code = readLines("final-project-chart1.R")}

This chart displays race compared to workclass. 
As shown, White individuals have the highest rate of employment in all of the included classes 
(federal gov, local gov, private, self-emp-inc, self-emp-not-inc, and state-gov). 
The most noticeable disparity is the difference between White people that are employed in private work classes ccompared to those of other races. 
White has the highest number, with a count over 500, whereas Black comes in second, with less than 100. 
This not only shows that race plays a role in employment, but that its impact seems to be significant. 
Level of employment directly translates to level of income, which is why analyzing how race plays a role in employment is important to tackling racial disparities regarding income.
